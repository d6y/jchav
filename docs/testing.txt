jchav.test.data.dir is a simple testing property in place for locating test data.

When running tests you must have the System property set to the test data area, e.g.:

    -Djchav.test.data.dir=path/to/jchav/testdata -ea

The Ant build in the etc fiolder will set this automatically.



== Notes on running unit tests from IDEs ===============================================


IntelliJ IDEA users

 * In Preferences/Compiler ensure that ?*.css is included in the "Resource Patterns"
   field.

 * When setting up a run of the unit tests (e.g., by right-clicking on the junit
   folder and selecting Run "All Tests"), ensure that the VM arguments are set
   up to turn on assertions and to set the jchav.test.data.dir property.  E.g.,:
   -Djchav.test.data.dir=path/to/jchav/testdata -ea
