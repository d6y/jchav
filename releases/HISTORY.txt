  - Issue 23: support for <fileset> in the Ant task
    http://code.google.com/p/jchav/issues/detail?id=23
  - consequential deprecation of srcdir in the Ant task. Migrate by replacing

	  <fileset dir="SOME_DIR" includes="**/*.xml" />
    </jchav>

* Release 1.1.1, 2007-12-22
  MD5 (jchav-1.1.1.zip) = 574a6a091b13bb324bcd6d451fc33e89

  - Documentation updates.
  - Suplied User-Agent in the example JMeter tests so the Digg example runs.
  - We can now read the HTTP status code from JMeter results -- although how we use this value
    to show error status codes is up for discussion.
  - Fix for issue 18: the length of the filenames created by JChav could cause a problem
    for some operating systems.  The filesnames are now MD5 hashes, which should resolve
    this issue.
  - Tested against JMeter 2.2 and 2.3.1 (both JDK 1.5)


* Release 1.1.0, 2006-10-20
  MD5 (jchav-1.1.0.zip) = b942e914942623ace4d5fd2c01cb9e0a

  - charts now default to all having the same scale, configurable
    via the uniformYAxis="true|false" in Ant and Maven
  - maven plugin for jchav task (thank you Tim McCune)
  - bug fix for min or max values that were not set when
    the first value was both the min and the max.  Behaviour
    was that some values in the results were very large.
  - minor chart tweeks: removal of x-axis labels from thumbnail;
    switch of colours of min,max,mean points.
