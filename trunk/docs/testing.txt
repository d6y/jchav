jchav.test.data.dir is a simple testing property in place for locating test data.

When running tests you must have the System property set to the test data area, e.g.:

    -Djchav.test.data.dir=path/to/jchav/testdata -ea

The Ant build in the etc folder will set this automatically.



== Notes on running unit tests from IDEs ===============================================


IntelliJ IDEA users

 * In Preferences/Compiler ensure that ?*.css is included in the "Resource Patterns"
   field.

 * When setting up a run of the unit tests (e.g., by right-clicking on the junit
   folder and selecting Run "All Tests", and selecting JUnit), ensure that the
   VM arguments are set up to turn on assertions and set the
   jchav.test.data.dir property. E.g.: -Djchav.test.data.dir=testdata -ea

 * The tests need src/ to be on the classpath when running tests in order to
   to be able to copy css and jpg files.  If you find ControllerTest failing
   because of a FileCopy problem, set the module to output test and production
   code to the same directory, and then force a project rebuild.
